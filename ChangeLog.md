# ChangeLog for http2

## 5.3.10

* Introducing closure.
  [#157](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/157)

## 5.3.9

* Using `ThreadManager` of `time-manager`.

## 5.3.8

* `forkManagedTimeout` ensures that only one asynchronous exception is
  thrown. Fixing the thread leak via `Weak ThreadId` and `modifyTVar'`.
  [#156](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/156)

## 5.3.7

* Using `withHandle` of time-manager.
* Getting `Handle` for each thread.
* Providing allocSimpleConfig' to enable customizing WAI tiemout manager.
* Monitor option (-m) for h2c-client and h2c-server.

## 5.3.6

* Making `runIO` friendly with the new synchronism mechanism.
  [#152](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/152)
* Re-throwing asynchronous exceptions to prevent thread leak.
* Simplifying the synchronism mechanism between workers and the sender.

* Using `http-semantics` v0.3.
* Deprecating `numberOfWorkers`.
* Removing `unliftio`.
* Avoid `undefined` in client.
  [#146](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/146)

## 5.3.4

* Support stream cancellation
  [#142](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/142)

## 5.3.3

* Enclosing IPv6 literal authority with square brackets.
  [#143](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/143)

  only 2. No API changes but workers do not terminate quicly. Rather
  workers collaborate with the sender after queuing a response and
  finish after all response data are sent.

  suitable for control frames. 　For example, the dependency of all
  control frames is stream 0.  So, PSQ does not contain multiple
  control frames at the same time.  We removed enqueueControl. Users
  should prepare a queue for control frames by themselves.
