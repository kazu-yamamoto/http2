## 1.6.0

* Reverse indices of HPACK are now based on tokens.
* New APIs: encodeTokenHeader and decodeTokenHeader.
* Deleted API: encodeHeaderBuffer -- use encodeTokenHeader instead.
* New module: Network.HPACK.Token

## 1.5.4

* Fixing a bug due to misuse of memcpy(). (#8)

## 1.5.3

* Adding debug information.

## 1.5.2

* Minor optimization for HPACK.

## 1.5.1

* Adding a missing file for testing.

## 1.5.0

* New API for HPACK. HPACK is much faster than 1.4.x (roughly x3.2).
  The default encoding is now Linear instead of LinearH.

## 1.4.5

* Removing zero reset from priority queues.

## 1.4.4

* Fixing a bug of reverse index.

## 1.4.3

* Priority benchmark is now external information versions.
* Using proper baseDeficit for deletion.

## 1.4.2

* Test files are now self-contained.

## 1.4.1

* The reverse indices for static and dynamic are combined for performance.

## 1.4.0

* Providing dequeueSTM, isEmpty and isEmptySTM. Users can compose
  their own control queue with dequeueSTM and isEmptySTM.

* Removing enqueueControl: it appeared that PriorityTree is not
  suitable for control frames. ã€€For example, the dependency of all
  control frames is stream 0.  So, PSQ does not contain multiple
  control frames at the same time.  We removed enqueueControl. Users
  should prepare a queue for control frames by themselves.

## 1.3.1

* Defining IllegalTableSizeUpdate.

## 1.3.0

* APIs `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are changed again. `Precedence` is introduced.

## 1.2.0

* APIs of `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are changed. `delete` is provided. Internal data structure is changed from random skew heap to priority search queue.
